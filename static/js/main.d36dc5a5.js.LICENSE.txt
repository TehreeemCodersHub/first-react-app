//! imparitive?? ---> in this approach we tell the browser how to do things(meaning in vanila javascript when we try to build ui --slect mnually element --traverse the dom and attach the event handler then each time something happen in the app like click on the browser we give browser ste by stp instruction or doing all thing in complex data its treally difficult to do that why we are using react library)
